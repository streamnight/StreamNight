# Compiling StreamNight

## Getting Ready

### Build Prerequisites

* [.NET Core 2.2 SDK with ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
* [DSharpPlus Nightly Builds](https://nuget.emzi0767.com/gallery/package/DSharpPlus/4.0.0-nightly-00619)
* Microsoft LibMan ([.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/libman-cli?view=aspnetcore-2.2)/[Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/libman-vs?view=aspnetcore-2.2))

DSharpPlus requires some extra work because we're using nightly builds from their SlimGet instance.

Other dependencies should be automatically installed through NuGet.

#### Installing DSharpPlus

You'll need to add the NuGet feed to [your NuGet configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior). As of 2019-07-20, that's adding this line to your NuGet.Config inside `packageSources`:

    <add key="DSharpPlus" value="https://nuget.emzi0767.com/api/v3/index.json" />

If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project, press `Manage NuGet Packages...`, press the cog next to `Package Source`, and create a new NuGet source.

You should now be able to [restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore) StreamNight's NuGet dependencies without running into issues. The .NET Core SDK should automatically run this when building with version 2.0 or above, but it's best to make sure everything's working as intended before moving on.

#### Installing SignalR Client

StreamNight's repository should already have the SignalR client code present in the `wwwroot/lib` folder, but you can update the version used by running LibMan's restore command. 

See the link in the prerequisites section for more information.

## Compiling StreamNight

StreamNight uses [publish profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles?view=aspnetcore-2.2) to simplify the build process down to one command or three clicks in Visual Studio.

This table lists the current settings in the shipping publish profiles:

| Name           | Build Configuration | Architecture                | Target Framework | Requires Runtime | Binary Location                  |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `nc-rel-22-fd` | Release             | Any CPU (32-bit and 64-bit) | .NET Core 2.2    | Yes              | `bin\pub\Release\netcoreapp2.2\` |

It's possible to have a [self-contained deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/index) that doesn't require the .NET Core runtime, but these instructions assume you're creating a framework-dependent deployment.

#### Visual Studio (Windows-only)

1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer
2. Click `Publish...`. It should have a blue globe icon in Visual Studio 2017/2019.
3. Select the publish profile. The default should be `nc-rel-22-fd`, check the table above for more information.
4. Press `Publish`.

#### .NET Core CLI (Cross-platform)

**Unfortunately, publish profiles don't seem to be working so you'll need to manually specify the options on the command-line.**

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run `dotnet publish -c Release -f netcoreapp2.2 -o bin\pub\Release\netcoreapp2.2\`

After compiling StreamNight, follow the instructions for pre-built binaries on the installation page.
