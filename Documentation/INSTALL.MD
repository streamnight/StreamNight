# Installation

## Using Pre-built Binaries

### Runtime Prerequisites

* [.NET Core 3.0 with ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Configuring StreamNight

You'll need to edit and place two configuration files alongside the DLLs in the program's working directory.

#### appsettings.json

This file contains the settings for the frontend.

### Adding Files

#### Default Mobile Logo

Although StreamNight can display your server's icon on the mobile header, it still needs a default one to fall back to if it can't download it or if you'd prefer to use a static icon.

Place the PNG icon at `wwwroot/images/staticlogo.png`.

#### HLS Master Playlist

Create the file specified in `appsettings.json` and paste the contents of your master playlist.

A typical playlist might look like this:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE,BANDWIDTH=4192000,RESOLUTION=1920x1080
https://stream.example.com/hls/1080.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE,BANDWIDTH=2628000,RESOLUTION=1280x720
https://stream.example.com/hls/720.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE,BANDWIDTH=1596000,RESOLUTION=960x540
https://stream.example.com/hls/480.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE,BANDWIDTH=564000,RESOLUTION=640x360
https://stream.example.com/hls/360.m3u8
```

The quality selector will display the vertical resolution of each entry.

### Running StreamNight

Run `dotnet StreamNight.dll --server.urls=https://0.0.0.0:5050` to start StreamNight listening on all interfaces at port `5050`.

While it's possible to use StreamNight's internal HTTP server (ASP.NET's Kestrel) facing the internet instead of using another web server such as Microsoft IIS, Apache, or Nginx, we recommend using a reverse proxy as StreamNight doesn't currently support serving HLS files. 

**You must use HTTPS for the reverse proxy, as Discord's OAuth relies on an initial HTTPS callback.**

We recommend [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as it gives you automatic trusted HTTPS for free, but any web server with support for WebSocket proxying should work.

##### Sample Caddy Configuration

```
stream.example.com {
    tls PUT YOUR EMAIL HERE!
    gzip
    proxy / https://stream.example.com:5050 {
        transparent
        websocket
        header_downstream Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
		insecure_skip_verify
    }
}
```

Note: This assumes you're not hosting the HLS files on the same machine. You'll need to add another location block if you're doing so.

You may opt to skip `insecure_skip_verify` in the configuration if you set StreamNight to use a valid HTTPS certificate, but self-signed certs are good enough if you have another web server in front of StreamNight.
