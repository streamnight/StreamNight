You should put three files here:
A poster for the offline stream (poster-offline.png)
A poster for the online stream (poster-online.png)
A fallback logo if it can't load your server's logo (staticlogo.png)

The bot will download your guild's logo to this folder if enabled. 
It'll redo it every hour or so, so there's no need to restart the application if you've changed the logo.

This file is publicly visible, so delete it before going live!
