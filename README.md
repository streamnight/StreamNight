## Introduction

StreamNight is a HLS streaming frontend with Discord integration.

Features include:

* Two-way Discord integration, with support for both Unicode emoji and server emotes

* Fully responsive UI that naturally scales from phones to PCs

* Theoretically unlimited users

* A reliable video player (video.js) with a manual quality switcher

* Works on all up-to-date modern browsers. Partially works on Internet Explorer 11

## System Requirements

StreamNight will run on anything that supports [.NET Core 2.2](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2-supported-os.md), but it's best to host it on a machine with a fast, reliable internet connection.

It'll generally use 400-500MB of RAM on a machine with memory to spare.

## Installation

See the wiki or INSTALL.MD for installation instructions.

## Release Information

This repository is the public version of the stream software, and most of the dev work happens in a private repo.

I'm not planning to explicitly mark anything as stable until I write proper tests, but it should be fine for day-to-day use.
